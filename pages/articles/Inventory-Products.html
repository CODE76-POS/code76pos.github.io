        <h2><strong></strong>STEP 2: FEEDING IN YOUR PRODUCT INFO INTO CODE76 POS.</h2>
        <p>
            Now that the Inventory Entry Page is Displayed, we start typing our Product information.</br>
            Follow the entry box placeholders and labels as your guide. </br>
            Fill in all the required product information such as: service code/id, service name, service group name or name 2, age restriction, etc. </br>

            You just need to know 2 and leave the rest empty an the calculation will be done for you automatically.</br>
            For example, just type in the mark up & Buying Price to get Selling Price, or type in the Buying price and Mark up to find the Selling Price </br>
            or Just type in the Buying Price & Selling Price to get the Mark up. </br>
