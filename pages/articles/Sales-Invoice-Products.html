            On The Sales Invoice Display Page, there are features such as: </br>
            Display Table and Green Buttons –With inscriptions explaining what they do.</br>
            In this case, We are Just interested in that green “ADD  INVOICE” Button.</br>

            Follow the entry box placeholders and labels as your guide.</br>
